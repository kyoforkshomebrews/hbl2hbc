# hbl2hbc
Boot from the wiiu homebrew launcher into the vwii homebrew channel, skipping controller and screen option prompts.

# Usage
1. Grab the .zip from the downloads section, put it into your sd folder.
2. If you don't want to be able to launch other Wii titles than the Open Homebrew Channel (OHBC) you can skip to step "4."
3. Edit sd:/wiiu/apps/hbl2hbc/hbl2hbc.txt, in the form of one or multiple lines in the format of "TitleID=TileName", to change the target channel, or create a menu of target channels.
4. Every time you want to get into the vwii open homebrew channel just start it in the wiiu homebrew launcher.
